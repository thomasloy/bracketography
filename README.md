bracketography
==============
###Innovative
bracketography is the first in a line of hilarious ways to analyze the outcome of the NCAA tournament.
###Professional, Design-Oriented, Christian Userbase
bracketography currenty does no analysis but instead predicts, until the games are over we will be looking past NCAA Tournaments and then making assumptions from those. What a fun project!
###Open Source
if you can get someone to pay you for this code, then you are more of a man than i am. Good Luck stealing the greatest set of tools man has ever written
